# VGMnn

TensorFlow DNN (Deep Neural Network) classifier that classifies video games music (MIDI files) according to the game series they belong to. It is however still under development, as a DNN is not the appropriate model to classify such sequential data : it is being transformed into a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), possibly with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) cells.
